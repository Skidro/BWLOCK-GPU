# Introduction
======================
This repository contains all the scripts needed to reproduce experiments from
our ECRTS-18 paper:
**Protecting Real-Time GPU Kernels on Integrated CPU-GPU SoC Platforms**

# Pre-requisites
======================
## Hardware
+ NVIDA Jetson TX-2 Board
+ SSD (Optional)

## Software
+ CUDA Runtime Library (Version-8.0)
+ Linux for Tegra (Version 28.1)
+ Python (Version 2.7)
+ Matplotlib

# Directory Structure

# Setup
======================
We recommend that the TX-2 be flashed with Jetpack-3.0 before proceeding with
the following steps.

# Experiments
======================
**NOTE: Before running the experiments, make sure that the device is in max-performance state**
